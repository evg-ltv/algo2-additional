A couple of algorithms implementations inspired by Coursera's "Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2" (https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2) class which are NOT part of homework.

This project includes:
 - Huffman Coding
 - Weighted Independent Set Problem (WIS)
 - Sequence Alignment
 - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
